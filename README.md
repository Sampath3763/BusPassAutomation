# 🚌 Bus Pass Automation System

A **frontend-only prototype** of a Bus Pass Automation System built using **React**, **TypeScript**, and **shadcn/ui**. This application simulates the student bus pass registration and approval process using in-memory data structures (no backend).

> ⚡ A modern solution to eliminate the inefficiencies of traditional paper-based bus pass management systems.
